    <div class="paragraph">People often accumulate great wealth only to lose their fortune and gain it again in cycles.
        She argues this is due to the law of attraction. People lose money because they allow “fearful
        thoughts of losing wealth to enter their minds,” causing their fears to be realized.
        Once the money is gone, their fear disappears as well, and they are able to focus on rebuilding their fortune.
        This is the law of attraction in a nutshell – if you think it, it will happen.

        <p>“Like attracts like” – so envisioning
            riches will actually bring you wealth. Byrne means this literally. She believes that thoughts are magnetic,
            emitting a
            positive or negative frequency. Whatever thoughts you send out into the Universe will attract similar
            energies before
            returning like a boomerang. She explains, this is not different to watching TV. You receive a signal that
            the channel
            is programmed to send you. If you want to see something different, you have to change the channel. Thus the
            importance
            of positive thinking and sending the right frequency into the Universe. </p>

        <p>Byrne notes that “your life right now is a reflection of your past thoughts.” If you’re doing well, you’ve
            been thinking
            positively. If not, it’s because you’ve been too negative. Byrne points out that most people don’t even
            realize they are thinking negatively. The problem is that the Universe doesn’t
            understand the word “no.” As a result, the Universe interprets “I don’t want to be late” as “I’ll be late.”
        </p>

        <p>Throughout the chapter, Byrne explains the science behind the law of attraction. She claims that it is
            supported by quantum
            physics, where the consensus is that the mind is powerful enough to create anything – including the Universe
            itself. Thus, the
            law of attraction is a law of nature. Like gravity, it applies whether you know it or not. The benefit of
            understanding the
            law of attraction is that you can use it to your advantage once you know how it works. </p>

        <p>Bill Harris, a teacher and founder of Centerpointe Research Institute, shares a story next. A former student
            named Robert
            faced constant harassment from his coworkers for being gay. Robert dealt with the stress by complaining to
            his teacher,
            who encouraged him to focus instead on his passion of becoming a stand-up comedian. Within 8 weeks of this
            change, the bully
            coworkers either left the company or were transferred to a different department. </p>

        <p>Byrne explains that it takes more than a single negative thought for bad things to happen. She claims you can
            start changing
            the way you think by becoming aware of your thoughts, suggesting 10 minutes of meditation per day. Negative
            thinking is
            extremely powerful, and Byrne ends by warning the reader that the 1st step to a better life is changing your
            attitude. </p>

            <em>Furthermore</em> gratitude attracts positive situations in your life such as:
            <ol id="numberedlist">
                <li>Healthy relationships</li>
                <li>Sucessful career</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="paragraph2">The law of attraction is always at work. If you think you have no control over your
                destiny,
                then you will attract situations that render you helpless. The trick,
                she says, is to tell the Universe you have control over your life.

                Byrne offers a tip to tell whether you’re thinking negatively: listen to your body.
                Too much worrying often brings pain in your stomach or chest. Byrne goes one step further,
                arguing that these feelings are actually a message from the Universe. She quips this is the
                Universe’s way of saying “Warning! Change thinking now. Negative frequency recording. Change frequency.
                Warning!”

                Byrne closes by introducing the concept of “Secret Shifters.” These are activities that can
                help brighten your spirits so you don’t stay focused on negativity. Byrne suggests making a list
                of things that can help shift mood in times of distress, such as a fun song or thinking of a loved one.

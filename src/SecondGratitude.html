    Ways to cultivate gratitude
    <br>
    <div class="par">Gratitude is a way for people to appreciate what they have instead of
        always reaching for something new in the hopes it will make them happier,
        or thinking they can't feel satisfied until
        every physical and material need is met. Gratitude helps people refocus on
        what they have instead of what they lack. And, although it may feel contrived
        at first, this mental state grows stronger with use and practice.

        Here are some ways to cultivate gratitude on a regular basis.

        Write a thank-you note. You can make yourself happier and nurture your relationship
        with another person by writing a thank-you letter expressing your enjoyment and
        appreciation of that person's impact on your life. Send it, or better yet, deliver
        and read it in person if possible. Make a habit of sending at least one gratitude
        letter a month. Once in a while, write one to yourself.

        Thank someone mentally. No time to write? It may help just to think about someone
        who has done something nice for you, and mentally thank the individual.

        Keep a gratitude journal. Make it a habit to write down or share with a loved one
        thoughts about the gifts you've received each day.

        Count your blessings. Pick a time every week to sit down and write about your blessings
        — reflecting on what went right or what you are grateful for. Sometimes it helps to
        pick a number — such as three to five things — that you will identify each week. As
        you write, be specific and think about the sensations you felt when something good happened to you.

        Pray. People who are religious can use prayer to cultivate gratitude.

        Meditate. Mindfulness meditation involves focusing on the present moment without judgment.
        Although people often focus on a word or phrase (such as "peace"), it is also possible to
        focus on what you're grateful for (the warmth of the sun, a pleasant sound, etc.).
